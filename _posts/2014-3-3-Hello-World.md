Hi, I'm Reed, and welcome to my first blog post!

In today's post I will be answering a few questions about my expectations for this course, Object-Oriented Programming with Glenn Downing.

## What are your expectations of the class?

## What did you do this past week?

## What's in your way?

## What will you do next week?

## What's my experience of the class?

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
