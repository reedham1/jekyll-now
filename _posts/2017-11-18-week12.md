### What did you do this past week?
This past week I was flown out to Madison, Wisconsin to interview with a healthcare software solutions company called Epic. This caused me to miss classes on Monday and work on Tuesday, but it was totally worth it because I got the offer! This was a huge relief, as I am going abroad next semester and I was really hoping not to have to worry about securing a summer internship while abroad. Besides this, I continued my regular routine consisting of work and school. It is about time to begin studying for finals! 
 
### What's in your way?
As I mentioned, finals are right around the corner. I need to get the next project for this class, Life, out of the way ASAP so I can really begin to focus my time and energy towards doing well on my finals. My two CS classes do not have explicitly cumulative finals, but final midterms rather. This is nice because I have seen the format of the exams and have a very good idea of what to expect. 

### What will you do next week?
This coming week I will be working with my partner to get as much done on the Life project as possible before the Thanksgiving break. Tuesday afternoon I will be flying out to Naples, Florida to visit my dad and stepmom for Thanksgiving on the beach! I am very excited for this, as fishing is one of my favorite things to do while on vacation. Although I will certainly have a relaxing and fishing-filled time with my dad and stepmom, I unfortunately will need to work on Life as well. At least it's programming and not some boring math homework or something.

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class has continued to be positive. At this point, I am convinced it is worth my time to take Professor Downing's SWE course when I return to UT from Scotland. This is partly due to the fact that the material is important, but also because Professor Downing is simply a great teacher.

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a Java API which I use frequently at work called Jackson. Jackson is a high-performance suite of data-processing tools that allow Java programmers to quickly and easily parse and generate JSON encodings and bind data to application-level objects. Jackson also has additional data format modules which allow for the processing of other data formats as well, such as XML, YAML, CSV, and many others. Jackson credits itslef as being the "best JSON parser for Java," and I could not agree more.
