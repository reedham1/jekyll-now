### What did you do this past week?
This past week I took a finance midterm and studied a bit for my algorithms exam that is on Monday. I also went to Forest Trails Elementary School with the UTCS Roadhsow team and did a series of presentations for an event they have every year called STEAM Fest. This was a very cool experience because, although I have done plenty of these types of presentations before, this one was a formal event with catered food and scheduled rotations of students.
 
### What's in your way?
The algorithms exam I mentioned is the next thing I need to conquer. I did poorly on the first one, so I'm hoping this one will be better. I also need to get started on the current project in this class. 

### What will you do next week?
This coming week I will study for and take this exam, then I will do the project for this class, and finally I will begin preparing for an interivew I have next Tuesday, which I will be flying out to Wisconsin for. Also, my parents will be coming in town this coming weekend. I haven't seen them in a few months, so that will be nice.

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class has been wonderful. I really enjoy Professor Downing's lectures, as they are very organized and efficient. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is an open-source OSX application called ShiftIt. ShiftIt allows you to quickly manipulate window position and size using keyboard shortcuts. Many operating systems have this feature built-in already, and I find it surprising that OSX does not. This application fixes that issue.
