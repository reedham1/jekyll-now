### What did you do this past week?
I spent the beginning of this past week moving back into my apartment. I spent the holiday season in Lubbock, Texas, where I was born and raised. As much as I enjoy going back home for the holidays, it's always a pain to drive the 7 hours back and fourth (at this point, however, I'm fairly used to the long drive). I also attended each of my new classes for the semester for the first time.  

### What's in your way?
As of now, nothing seems to be in my way. I have all the school supplies and text books I need for the semester. So far, so good.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will probably begin doing some ground work on my online marketing class. Since the class is self-paced, I figured I would take a good amount of time early on in the semester to get ahead. I'm curious to see what kinds of marketing concepts we will be covering in this course. On top of this, I will be getting back into a routine of working out and reading books each day. 

### What's my expectation of the class?
Since I've taken Professor Downing's class before (Object Oriented Programming in the fall of 2017), I kind of know what to expect. I've heard that the first few weeks of that class and this class are very similar in nature, and so far that has proven to be true. I expect this class to teach me more about the workflows and tools used in industry for general software engineering, and of course, less C++ than OOP. I'm excited to see what this class has in store, but I know that Downing will continue to uphold the quality of lecture he always has.

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a book called Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World. This book was written by a Swedish Physician named Hans Rosling, who spent a large portion of his life and career studying and helping treat life-threatening diseases in rural areas of Africa. Because of this, he became devoted to educating the world about health, economics, poverty, disease, and genreal fact-based knowledge. What is interesting about this book, is that Bill Gates offered each 2018 graduate this book for free. I highly reccomend this book to everyone.
