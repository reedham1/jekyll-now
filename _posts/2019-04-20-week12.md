### What did you do this past week?
	Last weekend was Dad’s weekend for my fraternity, so I began the week hanging out with him around Austin. This taking up all of my weekend up until late Sunday, I had to hit the ground running with project 4 come Modany. I'm quite thankful that the due date was pushed back to Thursday, because we would not have gotten the the spot we wanted before the due date had it been on Tuesdat. I pretty much commited this whole week to working solely on that, which didn't leave much time to allocate towards my iOS project. Time for a context switch!

### What's in your way?
	No challenges are in my way right now. I have an essay due on Monday, so I will be doing that this weekend before then.

### What will you do next week?
	After writing the essay, I will begin working on finishing up our iOS app for this last release. After getting it to a point which we are happy with (at least baselevel ready for presentations the following week), I will need to re-read some of a book which was assigned to me for a final book report in my computational brain class. It is called “Counciousness and the Social Brain,” and is all about a theory which states that conciousness is the bounded collection of both the information of which we are aware of: the apple is red, the table is flat, etc., plus the awareness itself: the fact that we can report “the table is flat and i’m aware of that.” This 4 page book report is due in about a week.

### What was your experience of Project #4: IDB3? 
	My experience of this phase of the IDB project was pretty positive. Since I've been pretty busy on the weekends with family in town, I had to do all the work for this phase during the week. I thought the lectures on SQL helped a lot in implementing sorting, searching, and filtering. Knowing the underlying queries that were actually being made was a huge benefit while working with SQLAlchemy.

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
	My pick-of-the-week is a website called [Wall Street Survivor](https://www.wallstreetsurvivor.com). Wall Street Survior aims to help people practice investing with fake money. You can start with $100,000, for example, and invest it how you want. You can keep up with it day-to-day just like it were real. I started using it at the start of last summer, and kind of wish I would have actually invested!
