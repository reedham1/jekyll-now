### What did you do this past week?
This past week I spent a lot of time prepping for all the deadlines and exams I have this coming week. These include two presentations, an exam, and a book report. Thankfully I have already finished the book report, which clears up space in my schedule to focus on the presentations and exam. I also did some planning for the Hawaii trip I have planned with the boys after graduation.

### What's in your way?
The most pressing of issues are the presentations. I have both of them back-to-back on Monday, which is not great because I'll be up the night before (tonight) prepping for them, but also kind of good that they will be out of the way at the same time.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will study for the exam in this class mostly. This will be on Thursday night, and after that I will have to context switch over to studying for my marketing exam which is the following week.

### What did you think of the talk by Miriam? 
I really enjoyed Miriam's talk. I thought she was very inspiring. I especially liked her consulting insight she had when she spoke about her management philosiphies in terms of hiring and recruiting. She seemed like she had a lot of wise knowledge that many students in our shoes could benefit greatly from.

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is Trello. Many of you have probably used Trello for issue management before, but for those of you who have not, you should check it out. Trello is similar to GitLab issue boards, but is a little bit more light-weight and has more customizability for the notifications. I found it nice while working with my iOS team, since we didn't use GitHub's features all that often.
