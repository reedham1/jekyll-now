### My experience of CS371p: Object-Oriented Programming with Glenn Downing
This post will be a summary of my experience of Object-Oriented Programming with Professor Downing. The semester is finally wrapping up, and although I feel like I've aged 5 years, I must say, I have learned a whole lot. Here's why...

The class begins fairly simple. After the first week or two of lecture you may find yourself convinced that this class will be easy, not too much work, etc. The first project is pretty straight forward, and Professor Downing helps everybody out by throwing out ideas as to where to go with the implementations needed to pass the stress tests (as he often does, but the first project especially so). Again, at this point you may feel as though you can get away with putting this class on the backburner, but don't do it. It gets more challenging, in a good way.

Although your initial assumptions that the class is easy or the class won't be too much work may or may not end up being true, you will most certainly learn something from Professor Downing. His lectures are so great; he is very organized and efficient with his time in class. Now would also be a good time to mention that you will not get away with not going to class. Not only are there daily quizzes, but he calls on students randomly many times throughout each lecture and will take note if you are not present (you don't want to miss his lectures anyway). The quizzes are nice because they are challenging enough to force you to know the material covered in the previous lecture. This class is very C++ intensive, so as you are learning OOP concepts and design, you get pretty familiar with the C++ standard library as well. 

Periodically throughout the semester, Professor Downing invites former students to come to campus and give a presentation to his current students. These presenters are generally from tech companies in the Austin area. These are great opportunities to learn about different companies and even do a little networking. I thought this was a nice perk to being in Professor Downing's class.

All-in-all, even if you already know everything there is to know about C++, you will learn a great deal in this course. Professor Downing wants his students to learn and succeed. He exposes you to so many relevant tools in the industry of software development. I will most definitely be taking his Software Engineering course the next chance I get!
