### What did you do this past week?
This past week I took my secodn algorithms exam, which I believe went better than the first one. This was a bit of a relief and made the rest of the week a little less stressful. My lab partner and I then immediately switched our attention to Darwin until that was finished. Although it didn't take us too long to finish, we were still working up until two hours before the deadline because we started so late. All-in-all, this week was pretty good.

### What's in your way?
I will be missing class on Monday and work on Tuesday because a company is flying me out to Wisconsin for a final round interview. I am very much so looking forward to the interview, but hopefully missing class won't be too much of a hassel.

### What will you do next week?
Besides go to and from Wisconsin for the interview, I will probably catch up on finance, which is my online, self-paced class. I have a few friends in the class with me who are all behind as well, so maybe I'll team up with them to knock out a large portion of the work together. I am also signed up to attend a live jazz performance, which I will have to write an essay about as an assignment for my jazz class. 

### What's my experience of the class?
I thought the Darwin project was pretty cool. It reminded me a lot of Mike Scott's Critter assignment from CS312, except this time there was no starter code.  

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a browser automation tool called [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org). This program allows you to automate the user actions on a web browser. I was introduced to this tool at work for testing purposes, but users can use it for much more, such as regular every-day wed-based administration tasks. I wonder if it could be used for automatically registering for classes...?
