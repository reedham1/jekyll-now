### What did you do this past week?
For the latter half of the week I’ve been fighting off a pretty nasty sickness. Friday I woke up and finally went to thw UHS. It turns out I was running a 103 degree fever and have strep throat… Because of this, it’s been difficult to be produtive recently. I met with my iOS team on Tuesday and got a decent amount of work done. Besides this, I have not done much besides lay in bed.

### What's in your way?
Being sick has been the biggest challenge. It also has come at a bad time, since these next two weeks will be very busy with prepping for and giving project presentations, project final releases, a book report, and exams.

### What will you do next week?
I plan to put in as much legwork as possible on the aformentioned work. I will most likely clear any plans I had for the weekend, make sure I get enough rest, and work on the most pressing of those tasks during the day for the remainder of the weekend. Later today some friends are going to an exacpe room for one of their birthday's. Hopefully I'm feeling better by then! I also have a formal event for my fraternity at the end of the week. 

### What was your experience in learning about refactoring? 
I was not a fan of the refactoring lectures. I found them hard to stay interested in. I understand the importance of the material, however, there does not seem to be a "fun" way of teaching it. It is simply a fairly bland topic.

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a fun little program called lolcat. It works the same way as cat, but outputs text in rainbow colors. Lolcat is available for install on Linux. Check it out [here](https://www.tecmint.com/lolcat-command-to-output-rainbow-of-colors-in-linux-terminal/).
