### What did you do this past week?
This past week my partener and I completed our voting assignment for this class. I also began studying for my algorithms exam on Monday, which I will continue to do throughout the weekend. The school workload this past week has been fairly moderate, so I had some time to relax, workout, and allocate  some time to interview preperation. 

### What's in your way?
This algorithms exam is the only thing I would say is in my way at the moment. I need to study some of the material more, and I also need to practice a few new proof techniques that have been introduced in this course. 

### What will you do next week?
Next week will be a bit different for me due to the fact that I have a few interviews for Summer internships. I have not had any this year so far, and next week I have 3. This will require me to leave work quite early on Tuesday and Thursday, so I will be attempting to make up for these lost hours in my off time. 

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class has continued to be very positive. I am learning new things about object-oriented programming, and am getting pretty familiar with C++ as well. I really like the language, and Professor Downing brings out the best in it. 

### What's my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is a bike and run social media application called Strava. If you are into running, biking, or even swimming, this app is a great tool you can use to track your runs and share with your friends. The coolest thing about Strava is that it provides you with very detailed and accurate statistics about your runs which can assist you in reaching your fitness goals.
