### What did you do this past week?. 
This past week I spent a considerable amount of time studying for the exam in this class. Luckily, I was familiar with the test layout from Professor Downing’s OOP class a few semesters ago, which was also all on HackerRank. I also wrote a technical response to a neuroscience paper published by MIT’s neuroscience and cognitive science lab for my computational brain class. Besides these things, I worked on my two projects, which are in this class and iOS.

### What's in your way? 
I’m slightly concerned about project deadlines that fall right after spring break. Since I’ll be gone all week on a cruise, I will not have much time to spend on making progress on them (I’m actually writing this on my phone from the car on the way to Galveston right now).

### What will you do next week?
The week following spring break, I will definitely be going to work on the next releases of my two projects. As mentioned above, these are due a few days after the start of the week, so it will be a time crunch for sure. After that, however, I’ll be going back to a normal schedule which will consist of working out, reading books, and having a social life. Oh, and also squash with the boys.

### What was your experience of test one?
My experience of test one was surprisingly positive. I was expecting a more difficult exam. I cannot complain. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is my favorite quote. It goes: "To obtain a bird's eye is to turn a blizzard to a breeze." This quote is from one of my favorite bands, Incubus. I think this quote is especially insightful for students who have a lot on their plate, because even though things may be hectic and uneasy now, in the big picture, it will all even out.
