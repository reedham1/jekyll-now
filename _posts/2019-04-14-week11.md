### What did you do this past week?
This past week I spent a considerable amount of time working on my iOS app, which was due on Wednesday. After this, I began to commit a lot of time to the next phase in this class. My dad came into town this past Friday, so since then I have not had any time to work on this phase. Today, however, I worked with my team all day and made some decent progress. The cram begins!

### What's in your way?
Completion of this phase is what is in my way right now. I will be solely working on this until the due date on Tuesday. We have pretty much completed our backend with searching, sorting, and filtering implementations. Now, we need to focus on connecting these functionalities to the frontend. 

### What will you do next week?
As mentioned, I will be commiting a lot of time to the project in this class for the first half of the week. After this, I'll most likely take a day to relax. Hopefully the weather will be nice (and hot) so I can hang out by the pool at my apartment. So far this semester, I have not had a free day with nice weather to do so. Fingers crossed.

### What was your experience in learning about regular expressions and SQL? 
My experience in learing SQL in lecture was positive. I have used SQL a little bit in my past, but never was formally taught anything about it. I believe Professor Downing is the best person to teach this on a basic level, since his explanations of things are so logical.

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is an open-source OSX application called ShiftIt. ShiftIt allows you to quickly manipulate window position and size using keyboard shortcuts. For example, I have control + alt + option + any of the arrow keys make a window go to the left, right, up, or down. You can even set shortcuts to make windows go over to other screens if you have a multi-screen setup. Many operating systems have this feature built-in already, and I find it surprising that OSX does not. This application fixes that issue.
