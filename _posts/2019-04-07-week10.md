### What did you do this past week?
This past week I have primarily been working on smaller assignments for each of my classes, as well as my iOS project. The next release is due this coming Wednesday, so I need to keep working on that (it was a two week phase this time, so not a lot of time for a considerable amount of work). Other work included an essay for my computational brain class as well, which was on a study regarding decision making and empathy in rats. Besides this, my fraternity had Mothers' weekend this weekend, so I have been hanging out with my mom and taking her around Austin to do fun activities.

### What's in your way?
Before I can really start grinding on the next phase for this class, I need to finish iOS. Although this phase was a short one, for the next (and last) phase, we have four whole weeks. This means I can finish up the work for this phase on Wednesday and then pretty much spend an entire week solely devoted to phase three for this class.

### What will you do next week?
As mentioned, I will spend half the week working on iOS and the remainder of the week working on the software engineering project with my team. I also need to continue running each day to prepare for Longhorn Run at the end of the week. Also, my dad is coming into town next weekend as well, so I will be hanging out with him for a few day at the end of the week.

### What did you think of the talk by Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline?
I thoroughly enjoyed having Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline as guest lecturers. The talk was engaging and over some important material. I had those two in my UGS course my first semester, and have always wanted to take another course with them ever since. Although I never got the chance to do so, I saw last week's lectures as a little taste of what their ethics course might be like. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is a bike and run social media application called Strava. If you are into running, biking, or even swimming, this app is a great tool you can use to track your runs and share with your friends. The coolest thing about Strava is that it provides you with very detailed and accurate statistics about your runs which can assist you in reaching your fitness goals.
