### What did you do this past week?
This past week was a grind. Since my teams and I (for both iOS and software engineering) held off all the work for our projects until after spring break, we had a lot of work to do. The bulk of the work done this past week was for this class, although I did still have a decent amount of work to do for iOS as well. Since this phase of the project was very back-end heavy, it made it a little easier to commit more time to it each day, as I enjoy back-end work much more than front-end. We all worked diligently each day of the week to get it finished, and I must say, I'm proud of where we're at.

### What's in your way?
Time was the biggest challenging factor this past week. Although this was primarily due to break being in the middle of these project assignments, it was still our faults for burdening ourselves with that amount of work in just a few days. I like to see those late-night work sessions as a lesson in not only time management but also work ethic. If weâ€™re able to band together and work hard to finish an assignment by a certain deadline, we will be readily prepared to handle those types of situations in the workplace as well.

### What will you do next week?
My plans for the weekend is to catch up on smaller assignments in all my classes. Since the next deadline for the iOS project is in two weeks, come Monday, we need to hit the ground running on that as soon as possible. Then we will do it all over again in this class. 

### What was your experience of Project #3: IDB2?
My experience of this phase was quite positive, besides the lack of sleep. As aformentioned, I thoroughly enjoy the back end work on this project, which includes working with the database and API layer in the project. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to treat time as a scarce resource. It is very easy for a young person, like myself, to operate about our daily lives under the subconcious perception that life is some sort of continual flow of unlimited time. One may wake up every day thinking the things they do not get done today can simply be done tomorrow. While this may be the case a good percentage of the time, we cannot afford to think like this. Not only are we not even guaranteed a tomorrow, but there are a finite number of hours, minutes, and seconds in a day. Spend them wisely.
