Welcome back to my blog!

### What did you do this past week?
This past week I dove deeper into the material of all my courses, and even got some grades back on some assignments. I also began my new schedule at work, which is Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 am to 4 pm. As the UT CNS Technology and Sicence Career Fair is next week, I also attended some preparation events hosted by the Career Services.

### What's in your way?
Nothing seems to be in my way at this point. I have been able to manage my time well in getting everything started up with classes, but I unfortunately am slightly sick. This may become a bigger problem this upcoming week with the career fair and potential job interviews. 

### What will you do next week?
This next upcoming week I will be continuing to focus my attention towards the career fair, as well as attending it. I will also contunue to work on assignments, and even complete my first programming assignment for this course, which is the implementation of an algorithm that solves the infamous Collatz conjecture. Since this is the first project, I believe it will take a bit more time to get started up due to the fact that I will be adjusting to a new workflow in completing the project. 

### What's my experience of the class?
So far my experience of the calss has been great. Not only have I already learned quite a bit, but I am continuing to be challenged by daily quizzes and interesting lecture material. The demonstraions Professor Downing does in class are clear, engaging, and very informative. I believe this class will be a good one for me, as it seems to be a good balance of challenging and interesting. 

### What's my tip-of-the-week?
Since this week is the career fair, my tip-of-the-week to my fellow Longhorns is to take advantage of the awesome career preperation events that the UT Career Services provides for UT students. Not only are these events free, they are usually specifically designed to teach valuable skills that you will need in aquiring a job, communication with recruiters, or acing your interview in whatever field of study you may be in. I highly reccomend everybody to checkout what they have scheduled on their website. [Here](https://cns.utexas.edu/career-services) is the link to their CNS website.
