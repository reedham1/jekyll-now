Hi, I'm Reed, and welcome to my first blog post!

In today's post I will be answering a few questions about my expectations for this course, Object-Oriented Programming with Glenn Downing.

### What are your expectations of the class?
I first and foremost expect to come out of this class a more efficient, more knowledgable, and all around better programmer. Having had a considerable amount of object-oriented programming experience in the past, I believe this class will be of great benefit in sharpening my programming skills for better practices, as well as integrating new tools and teqhniques into my arsenal. 

### What did you do this past week?
This past week I prepared for the semester and attended all of my new classes for the first time. In this course, we were given an intorduction to the course and the professor himself, and were shown a few basic examples of C++ programs. We also learned about assertions in C++, and talked about cases in which assertions may be helpful or harmful in practice.

### What's in your way?
As of now, nothing is in my way. Instructions and expectations from the professor have been clearly communicated and seem reasonable for the course. I will be personally using a Mac OS for the assignments in this course, which makes following along with professor Downing's examples and execution paths straight forward, as he uses the same. 

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will continue to attend lecture and dive into the content of this course. I am excited to begin the assignments and soak up all of the knowledge and expertise Professor Downing has to offer.

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of this class so far has been a very positive one. I am thoroughly impressed by the professor's organized manner in which he runs the class and gives lectures.  

### What's my tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the day is brought to you by the intern who broke the automatic overnight build. It is this: always confirm unit testing is turned on in your build configurations before making a major push to your team's codebase at the end of the day, and take a quick glance at the tests' output to double check. If you don't, theres a good chance one or many have failed, and you are to blame for a broken build.
