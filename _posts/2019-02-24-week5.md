### What did you do this past week?
This past week I didn't do a whole lot. I began tinkering with some technologies that I will be most likely using for both my software engineering project (for this class), and my iOS project as well. We are in a somewhat weird place right now in both those classes; we have our projects approved but have not started on any design yet. I guess it's finally time for the workload to start ramping up this semester. Besides that, I also finished my first full essay for my Computatioal Brain class, which was on the brain's propensity to encode information in a sparse fashion. I'm finding that class very interesting.

### What's in your way?
Like I mentioned in the previous question, I need to start meeting with my project groups regularly and begin working. This week I will need to schedule a few meetings with both teams to get the ball rolling on these projects. The hard part about that will probably be finding recurring times that we are all available.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will be devoting most of my time to the aforementioned projects. I will also try to play some squash, since I've missed the last few sessions with my friends. I will also probably be reading a decent amount. I finished a few books last week which were really good, and when I finish a good book I'm always super motivated to start another. I'll probably start "Homo Deus" by Yuval Harari and "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas" by John Boyne, which is a really short read.  

### What did you think of the talk by Ed on GCP and Hannah on AWS? 
Although I unfortunately was feeling very ill on Friday and missed the talk about AWS, I thoroughly enjoyed the talk about GCP from Ed. Not only was it nice to see GCP in action, but his talk was very informative about cloud computing in general. I believe our team will be using AWS for a project, however, so I'm kind of bumed that I missed that one.

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a UI design software called Sketch. It seems to be very powerful, but also might have a somewhat steep learning curve. I like to compare it to the Photoshop of UI design: powerful but complicated. I found out about it last week, and will be using it to make mock-ups for my iOS app. The downside to it is that it cost money and is only for MacOS. If you dont use Macs, Figma is a good alternative. Figma is also free!
