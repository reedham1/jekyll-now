### What did you do this past week?
This past week was quite hectic. I worked on the first project for this class, as well as homework for all of my other classes. On top of this, the Science and Technology Career Fair was this week. For this, I did a fair amount of planning, and I believe it paid off. My sister also came into town for a friend's wedding, so I got to catch up with her.

### What's in your way?
Besides still being slightly sick, nothing really stands in my way at this point in the semester. Having made it through all the craziness that comes along with career fair week, I feel like some weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. As for specific blockers in the class, I cannot seem to get the hang of the daily quizzes. 

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will hopefully have more time to take it easy. Since I missed a full day of work on Thursday for the career fair, I will have to work a few extra hours to make up for this lost time. Besides that, there is not much on the schedule. I will most likely play a few rounds of golf in my spare time.

### What's my experience of the class?
Since we had our first programming assignment due for this class this past week, I now have a better gauge of what this class will be like for the remainder of the semester. I really enjoyed the first project, and the tools and applications we were exposed to were very useful and interesting. These included tools like Doxygen, Docker, Travis CI, and Clang-Format. Overall, it has been a positive experience.

### What's my tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a book called Cracking the Coding Interview. Many of you may have heard of it or may have even read parts of it, but for those of you who have not, I'd highly recommend checking it out. It is full of great tips and techniques in acing that intimidating technical interview, and has plenty of practice problems. It can be purchased from Barnes and Noble for $28.45 [Here](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/cracking-the-coding-interview-gayle-laakmann-mcdowell/1122334602/2672211438453?st=PLA&sid=BNB_DRS_Marketplace+Shopping+greatbookprices_00000000&2sid=Google_&sourceId=PLGoP24165&k_clickid=3x24165).
