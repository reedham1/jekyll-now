### What did you do this past week?
This past week I began getting into the routine of my day-to-day schedule around my classes and other extracurriculars. It felt nice to do this again after the long, lazy winter break, but it also feels strange knowing this will be the last time. One thing that I've been doing a fair amount of is playing squash again with my buddies. While I was studying abroad last year, I played squash a whole lot and got pretty decent. Since I've been back in the US, I haven't really gotten a chance to play again. This semester, I've been playing weekly. I have also been reading books for leisure every day. 

### What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way. It seems like this semster is off to a good start. I hope things continue to go smoothly for me.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will begin the first programming assignment for this course. Since I've taken Professor Downing's OOP class before, I know what to expect for this first project (I beleive, from what I can recall, that this project is the same as the first project in OOP). The solution to the problem isn't the time consuming part of the project, but rather the workflow that Professor Downing expects from us to complete it. Besides this, I will also need to consult with my group for my mobile computing class as to what we want to build for our iOS app group project. We have a few ideas, but may need to agree on one by the end of next week.

### What's my experience of the in-class exercise?
My experience of the in-class exercise was pretty positive. It is known that Professor Downing likes to utilize HackerRank as much as possible, so it was to no surprise that he is now using them for in-class learning exercise. I think HackerRank is a very nice tool also, and I think it is pretty cool that Downing uses it for things like this. I have no quarrels with Professor Downing's decision to use HackerRank in class.

### What's my tip-of-the-week?
On that note, my tip-of-the-week is to practice coding exercises in preperation for job interviews. This is something that all CS majors have heard from advisors, professors, recruiters, and peers at some point during their time in school. It just simply cannot be stressed enough. I wanted to put this as the tip-of-the-week because I personally would not be where I am right now in my CS career without coding exercise programs like HackerRank. Upon graduation in May, I will be starting work here in Austin at RetailMeNot. Last semester, I talked to a few recruiters at the FoCS event before the fall career fair, and from there landed an interview on-site. The final round interview was a half-day sequence of interviews, mostly technical. These technical interviews, especially in the last round, would have been extremely difficult had I not practiced on HackerRank during the weeks prior. Now with a nice job locked in for after graduation, I can relax a little during this last semester and feel confident that all my hard work has paid off. Thanks HackerRank.
