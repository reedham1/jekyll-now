This week, as Professor Downing is out of the country for a competitive programming competition, Dr. Elaine Rich and Dr. Alan Cline are giving lectures on ethics in software engineering. I had these two professors for a course on logic my freshman year, and I was quite excited when I found out they would be guest lecturers this week. I find them an extremely engaging and entertaining lecturer duo. Anyhow, as mentioned, the topic of lecture this week is ethics, and today in class they proposed a very interesting situation which they wanted us to give some thought towards.

The situation goes like this. You are a newly hired systems administrator at a small privately held manufacturing company. The owner would like honest feedback from his or her employees, and issues this statement: “I want to encourage each of you to make comments to me about any facet of our operation you care to. Your response should be made through our anonymizer program so that your identity will not be disclosed.” Now, before explaining the rest of the situation, it should be emphasized that this is the owner of a legitimate business with hundreds of employees. Anything he or she declares, especially towards the entirety of the company, is effectively set in stone when it comes to his or her reputation and credibility. Continuing the story, one of the responses the owner gets states: “This company sucks. The only way I find to retaliate for the way I have been treated is sabotage. Every tenth part I turn out is defective.” Now the owner has a serious dilemma on his or her hands, and comes to you, the system administrator to track down the anonymous alleged saboteur by looking at computer usage logs with regards to the anonymous feedback system. 

Before explaining my ethical understanding of the problem and what I would attempt to do to fix it, there a couple other important things that need to be pointed out. First of all, something quite obviously needs to be done about this situation. Threats like these come in all shapes and sizes and are often bogus, but in this situation, the treat cannot go unattended to. For a company which manufactures parts, it is safe to assume 1/10 of their product being faulty would cause serious hard to the company. Secondly, the owner essentially made a promise to the employees that responses in this system would be anonymous, and they confided in him that this promise would be held true. This anonymity is what empowered the employees to truly speak their mind, which is precisely what the owner wanted. However, in the case of this response, this employee abused this power and mistreated the entire company with not only their taunting response, but also their actions (assuming they were actually following through with their threat). 

Now I’ll put myself in the shoes of the systems administrator. If I were to do what the owner asked me to do and look at the computer records, then the system that the owner told the employees was anonymous would not actually be. This would be an ethics violation, and probably ruin the reputation of the owner in the eyes of the employees; this is not a good outcome of the situation. Although disobeying the orders of your boss is a problem in and of itself, I would try to explain this to them and pitch other means to track down the culprit, without compromising the anonymity of the feedback system. This could be achieved by simply monitoring the production line, or adding other safeguards in the production process (this could include peer reviews of code or designs, group tasks, or other measures which would result on more sets of eyes seeing potential threats in the company).
