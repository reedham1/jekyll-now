### What did you do this past week?
This past week I finished my thrid project for this class. This project was pretty cool because it involved both higher-level object-oriented programming as well as some lower-level system mechanics. Besides this, I also sgned up for a few finals and began studying for my next midterm in finance. Yesterday I went to my orientation for the UT Study Abroad program, and it really got me even more excited to go abroad than I was before. 
 
### What's in your way?
As I mentioned, I have a finance exam coming up which is on Thursday of this week. Immediately after this, I have an algorithms exam the following Monday. I have not begun to really study for these two exams because I have been so busy this week, so this is currently in my way. I need to allocate time to study for these each day this week, especially next weekend for algorithms. 

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will basically be going to class and studying/preparing for my midterms all week. I will also begin working on the next project for this class as well. It sounds like it will be a long week...

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class is still very positive. I am learning a lot, not only about C++, but object-oriented programming and design as well. Luckily, there is not an exam in this class for another fow weeks. This is allowing me to enjoy the class more at such a busy time in the semester like this. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is my favirite quote. It goes: "To obtain a bird's eye is to turn a blizzard to a breeze." This quote is from one of my favorite bands, Incubus. I think this quote is especially insightful for students who have a lot on their plate, because even though things may be hectic and uneasy now, in the big picture, it will all even out.
