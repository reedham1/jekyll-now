### What did you do this past week?
This past week I got back on my normal work and school routine. This was nice, but I had forgotten how busy even my normal schedule was. I did a presentation with another CS classmate on Friday at an elementary school called Harmony Science Academy for CS Roadshow. This was one of the best CS Roadshow experiences I have ever had because the kids were so smart and engaging. I also began the third project for this class, which is a dynamic memory allocation manager.

### What's in your way?
The business of my schedule is really what is in my way right now. I am behind on a lot of work, but this seems to always be true this semester. I mainly need to catch up in my finance class because we have a midterm coming up in a few weeks. 
 
### What will you do next week?
Next week I will try my best to catch up on all of my school work. I also need to finish my application to the University of Edinburgh for next semester. This will include an essay and my course selections, which I an quite excited about. The School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh revolves around research and teaching in artificial intellignece, machine learning, and cognitive science. This being the case, they offer many specialized courses on related topics in these fields of study.

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class is still very positive. I am learning a lot, not only about C++, but object-oriented programming and design as well. 

### What's my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to treat time as a scarce resource. It is very easy for a young person, like myself, to operate about our daily lives under the subconcious perception that life is some sort of continual flow of unlimited time. One may wake up every day thinking the things they do not get done today can simply be done tomorrow. While this may be the case a good percentage of the time, we cannot afford to think like this. Not only are we not even guaranteed a tomorrow, but there are a finite number of hours, minutes, and seconds in a day. Spend them wisely.
