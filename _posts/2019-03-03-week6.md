### What did you do this past week?
This past week my team and I made some substantial progress on our project for this class. I'm glad to have Joel, who seems to really know what he's doing when it comes to AWS. We've successfully set up our dev and prod sites, and are now all working in React for phase one. I should also give come credit to our UI designers, Coleman and Lidnsey, for some awesome mockups. I also met with my iOS team to design our mobile app. In that class, we are ready to start in Xcode. 

### What's in your way?
We just need to get our site up to the standards for the phase one turn-in. This will require some work, but it should be the case that nothing is in our way. Also, as of yesterday evening, we had a problem with our CI in getting AWS to host our static files when we pushed code that produces warnings. This should be an easy fix today.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will continue to work with my team on our website. As mentioned in a previous question, I will also begin to work on my iOS app with that team as well. I'm hoping we can make enough progress on both projects before spring break, that way none of us have to worry about it while on vacation. I'm going on a cruise, so I definitely will not be thinking about school work all that much. Towards the end of this week, I'll be pretty busy with social events including a semi-formal and the Houston rodeo. This just means I'll have to work extra hard during the first half of the week.

### What did you think of the talk by Jesse on security?
I really enjoyed Jesse's talk. I thought the topic was really interesting, as it gave me a little insight into some simple hacking techniques. Although I will (probably) never use them,it was cool to see some of it in action. He seemed pretty prepared for his presentation, and I appreciated his use of Professor Downing's cold-calling technique to keep the class engaged. I would definitely take time out of my schedule to attend another talk about the same topic. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a mobile app called StumbleUpon. When you download the app, you make a little profile by selecting your interests. These interests include anything from hobbies to fields of study to travel locations. The app then lets you press a main button that loads a random webpage that it thinks you will enjoy. These pages may be articles, videos, or just about anything else on the internet. The app gets smarter when you like and dislike the pages it gives you. You can also favorite pages which are then saved for you to go back to later. This app is wonderful for developers who are looking for new tools and projects to use in their practices. Although the Apple app store has only a 2-star rating for this app, I give it 5.
