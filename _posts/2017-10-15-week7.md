### What did you do this past week?
This past week I had one job interview over the phone with a company in Wisconsin called Epic. This was the first job interview I have ever had that used the HakerRank feature CodePair. I thought this was a cool tool that job interviewers can use to see their applicants code in real time. I also sutddied for and took my first exam in this class. This exam went well and I believe I got a B overall. Although I was hoping for an A, I guess I can live with a B. 

### What's in your way?
My algorithms grade is starting to concern me at this point in the semester. I did not do well on the first exam; the class is just very difficult. Hopefully I'll be able to do much better on the next two exams. Besides this, nothing really stands in my way. 

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will catch up on my non-cs school work. Since I've had an exam both of these past two weeks in my cs courses, I have not had much time to allocate to my outher courses. If I catch up on these courses this week, I believe I'll be in good shape. I also plan to get back on my regular workout routine, which I have started to slack on in the recent weeks as well. On top of this, I'll finally have a normal work week at Applied Research Laboratories.

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class is still pretty positive. The only complaint I have is the daily quizzes are still pulling my grade down, but this is nobody's fault by my own. The first exam, as I mentioned before, went well. Now that I know what to expect for the exams, I think the rest of the semester will continue to go smoothly.

### What's my tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a mobile app called StumbleUpon. When you download the app, you make a little profile by selecting your interests. These interests include anything from hobbies to fields of study to travel locations. The app then lets you press a main button that loads a random webpage that it thinks you will enjoy. These pages may be articles, videos, or just about anything else on the internet. The app gets smarter when you like and dislike the pages it gives you. You can also favorite pages which are then saved for you to go back to later. This app is wonderful for developers who are looking for new tools and projects to use in their practices. Although the Apple app store has only a 2-star rating for this app, I give it 5.
