### What did you do this past week?
This past week I began working on my iOS app for my mobile computing class with my teammates. We decided on a scavenger hunt app, which utilizes Google Vision APIs to automatically evaluate the scavenger hunt image submisions. We're going to call it FindIt! I also began making some summer plans with friends and family, which will include a fishing trip to Alaska with my uncle and two cousins.

### What's in your way?
I rediscovered the marvels of Modern Warfare 2 a few nights ago. I used to play a lot when I was a kid, and didn't realize that they has since remastered the game for the Xbox One. I have since been slightly addicted to the game, To some degree, this is in my way because I should be more productive when I get home from meetings and class all day.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will work on my iOS app with my team some more. I will also probably start brainstorming project ideas for this class. 

### What was your experience of Project 1?
My experience of project 1, collatz, was pretty positive. I remembered all the necessary steps from the workflow from Downing's Object Oriented Programming class a few semesters ago, so it really didn't take too long. It was a good refresher on common software engineering practices like tending to a CI build and using programs like Black and Pylint to keep your code clean. As far as the content of the code, I found it much easier to solve this second time around.

### What's my pick-of-the-week?

My pick-of-the-week is a book called The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master. I aquired this book over the summer by spending my professional development budget ($50) at my internship at Epic. A few weeks ago I began casually reading it in my spare time, and the more I read the better the book gets! The authors introduce methodical ways to producing working, maintainable code. This is not a text book, but more of a manual with a stylistic novel-like touch. You can find the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X).
