### What did you do this past week?
This past week I studdied for and took my first exam of the year. It was better than I was anticipating, but I still believed I could have done better. I also had a few job interviews with ExxonMobil, Uber, and a healhcare solutons compnay based out of Madison Wisconsin called Epic. I also went to Austin CIty Limits this weekend, which has been extremely fun. Now time to get back to focusing on school.


### What's in your way?
The only thing I would consider to be in my way at the moment is all the administrative things that need to be taken care of with regards to my study abroad program. I got accepted recently to the program, and I now need to run a few errands this week to make sure everything is in place for me to leave in January. 

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will study for and take my next exam, which is in this class. I will also have a few more job interviews, one first round and the other is a second round. Once this exam is out of the way I'm hoping for a short (maybe week long) buffer period where there is not too much school work to do. During this time, I'll hopefully have some time to put in some hours at work and get back on track with my workout routine. 

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class is great. I'm learning a great deal about programming from Professor Downing. 

### What's my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is the STAR method of answering behaviorial interview questions. Some students would argue the behaviorial interview questions are a weaker suit for them, and for those students especially, I encourage you to read [this](https://careercenter.lehigh.edu/node/145 )article. Many of you may have heard of or used this question answering framework, but it is still a good thing to keep in mind while going in to an interview that may be less technical.
