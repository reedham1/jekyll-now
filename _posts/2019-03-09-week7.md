### What did you do this past week?
	This past week my team and I finished up phase one for our project, CatchMeOutside. Although we have been diligent in working at a healthy pace, we still found ourselves all working on finishing up lots of small details the night before the due date. In preparation for phase two, I also have been reading up on articles on tools like Flask and SQLAlchemy to hopefully help throughout. 

### What's in your way?
	We need to get some substantial work done before spring break. This shouldn't be a problem. We are meeting tomorrow morning to get a jump start on the week, and will delegate out work and get on the same page.  

### What will you do next week?
	As mentioned, I will start the week with a meeting with my group. We will most likely meet every couple days throughout the rest of the week as well. I will probably take the work as the API man. I have a decent amount of work experience with API development in Java, so I'd like to get a taste of what that looks like in Python using Flask and other related tools. I'd also like to help with the database, which of course will be interacted with by the API endpoints.  

### What was your experience of Project #2: IDB1? 
	I've enjoyed this project. I worked with React on a daily basis during my internship last summer, so it's nice to put that practice to use again and use it from another angle. I think this project will continue to be an enjoyable one to work on because I will be working with a lot of new tools on this next phase. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
	My pick-of-the-week is a Java API which I used frequently at work called Jackson (I realize this may not be useful for this project, but its a great tool nonetheless). Jackson is a high-performance suite of data-processing tools that allow Java programmers to quickly and easily parse and generate JSON encodings and bind data to application-level objects. Jackson also has additional data format modules which allow for the processing of other data formats as well, such as XML, YAML, CSV, and many others. Jackson credits itslef as being the "best JSON parser for Java," and I could not agree more.
