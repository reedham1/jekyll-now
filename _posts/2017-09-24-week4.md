### What did you do this past week?
This past week I had somewhat of a normal school and work week. I began working on project 2 for this class, and continued with the flow of usual assignments in my other courses as well. I also went to a local high school with some CS Roadshow team members to present about computer science as a field of study as well as within the University of Texas. 

### What's in your way?
I do not believe I have anything in my way at the moment; things seem to be going smoothly. 


### What will you do next week?
Next week I will work on and complete project 2 with my programming partner. I have my first exam in my algorithms class the following week, so I will most likely be putting in some hours at the library this coming week as well, especially towards the tail end. 

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class has continued to be quite positive. I especially enjoy the lectures themselves, as Professor Downing is very good at managing the little time we have in class each day, and is very clear and concise. 

### What's my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is a mocking framework for Java called Mockito. Mockito provides a very nice API that allows you to write simple and easy-to-read unit tests with mocking. Mocking is a good practice to use while writing unit tests if your tests need to isolate some object's functionality that is dependant or secondary to some other object. The project webpage can be found at [this link](http://site.mockito.org).
