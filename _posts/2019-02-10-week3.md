### What did you do this past week?
This past week I was both productive and unproductive. I started writing my first essay that is due for my computational brain class, but my roommates and I also broke out the old Xbox 360. The Xbox is quite the temptation, but I can feel better about myself knowing that my classes will get more time-demanding as the semester goes on, and playing it now is better than playing it later. I also started to plan my and my teams' iOS app for our mobile computing class.

### What's in your way?
Besides getting the ball rolling on the app for mobile computing, nothing is in my way at the moment. Sometime in the near future I need to start looking for apartments in the downtown area for after graduation, but I have some time before making a decision on that.  

### What will you do next week?
Next week I plan on getting ahead on my online marketing class. It would be nice to get as much of that out of the way as possible, that way I can devote more time and energy to my other three classes (all of which are computer science classes). I will also contiune my weekly workout schedule, and hopefully find time to play a little squash with the boys.

### What was your experience of learning the basics of Python?
I'm finding the lectures to match up pretty closely with the lectures given in Downing's object-oriented programming class last year, except in Python instead of C++ of course. The lectures are presented in a pretty methodical and logical fashion, and it is easy to follow along. Although I knew a lot of the Python basics, the lectures have been a good refresher on more specific, fine-grained information like underlying containers for common data structures, and operator behavior as well. I'm excited to get into more complex Python machinery. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is a website called [regexr.com](https://regexr.com). Regular expressions come up a lot in software engineering, as many of you probably know. Personally, I have found it to be a pain to try and remember all the specific character classes and rules for regular expressions (which is probably the best thing to do). Anyhow, if you're like me and want to take the lazy route, this website is a great place to help build the regex you need. It has a nice interactive utility interface which allows you to test your patterns against custom text input. It also has regex cheat sheets, references, and a board for posting and searching for other regular expressions made by the community.
